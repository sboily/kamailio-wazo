Hello !

This tutorial is to help people to use kamailio in front of to xivo. I'm
considering your XiVO is already installed or you following the getting started
in the xivo documentation. This tutorial is inspired by
http://kb.asipto.com/asterisk:realtime:kamailio-4.0.x-asterisk-11.3.0-astdb.

I'm using docker to install kamailio because it's simple to use and funny to
work with :) (please do not install docker on a xivo because wheezy don't
support the good kernel.
